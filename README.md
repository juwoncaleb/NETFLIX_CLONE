We all know how addictive netflix can be looooooool, I built my own netflix from the scratch. It was a long process , but i had fun building it  
Developed a Netflix clone, using REACT.JS on the client-side, FIREBASE as a database management service,and also to implement authorization and authentication.
Redux was applied for state management and React-route for seamless navigation without refreshing.
Styled components to write plain CSS in React without worrying about clashing names
Used compound components to reduce the complexity of the software architecture
